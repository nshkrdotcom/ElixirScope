# ElixirScope Layer 2 Progress Tracking

## Project Status: **ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT**
**Layer 2: Asynchronous Processing & Event Correlation**
**Started**: 2024-01-26

---

## Executive Summary

Layer 2 is responsible for consuming events from Layer 1's high-performance ring buffers, enriching them with metadata, establishing causal relationships between events, and persisting them for querying. This layer transforms raw event streams into meaningful, correlated execution histories.

## Current Phase: **Phase 1 - Core Pipeline** 
**Target**: Implement basic asynchronous processing pipeline

---

## Architecture Overview

Based on analysis of DIAGS.md, DIAGS_LAYER2.md, and DIAGS_DOCS_LAYER2.md:

### Layer 2 Components:
1. **PipelineManager** - Supervises all Layer 2 components
2. **AsyncWriterPool** - Manages worker processes that consume from ring buffers  
3. **AsyncWriter** - Individual workers that process events in batches
4. **EventCorrelator** - Establishes causal relationships between events
5. **BackpressureManager** - Monitors and manages system load
6. **WorkerPoolConfig** - Dynamic configuration management

### Key Design Principles:
- **Decoupled Architecture**: No blocking of Layer 1 event ingestion
- **Horizontal Scalability**: Worker pools scale based on load
- **Fault Tolerance**: Individual worker failures don't affect pipeline
- **Eventual Consistency**: Correlation happens asynchronously
- **Memory Efficiency**: Process events in batches
