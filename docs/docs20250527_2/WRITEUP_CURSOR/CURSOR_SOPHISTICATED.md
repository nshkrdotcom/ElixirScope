# CURSOR_SOPHISTICATED.md - Implementation Progress Tracker

## Mission Statement

Systematically migrate ElixirScope's AST infrastructure from broken basic implementations to sophisticated research-based designs that properly handle Elixir's unique semantics.

## Implementation Strategy

Based on our comprehensive analysis, we're following a **replace-not-fix** approach:

1. **Keep Working Foundation** - Core repository, runtime correlation, project discovery
2. **Replace Broken Components** - CFG/DFG/CPG generators with research designs
3. **Add Missing Sophistication** - SSA form, phi nodes, unified representations

## Phase 1: Foundation Stabilization ✅ STARTING

### Objective
Replace basic data structures with sophisticated research designs and ensure consistent EventStore integration.

### Tasks

#### 1.1 Data Structure Migration ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Replace `cfg_data.ex` with research-based CFGData structure
- [x] Replace `dfg_data.ex` with SSA-based DFGData structure  
- [x] Replace `cpg_data.ex` with unified CPGData structure
- [x] Create shared_data_structures.ex to avoid duplicates
- [x] Remove duplicate module definitions
- [ ] Update all imports and references

#### 1.2 EventStore Integration Audit ⏳ PENDING
- [ ] Verify all components use consistent EventStore API
- [ ] Test EventStore wrapper functionality
- [ ] Document integration patterns

#### 1.3 Working Component Verification ⏳ PENDING
- [ ] Run tests for core repository components
- [ ] Verify project_populator functionality
- [ ] Confirm runtime_correlator integration

## Phase 2: CFG Generator Rewrite ⏳ PLANNED

### Objective
Implement proper CFG generation with decision points complexity calculation and Elixir-specific semantics.

### Key Changes Needed
- Decision POINTS complexity calculation (not edges)
- Elixir-specific node types (pattern_match, guard_check, pipe_operation)
- Proper state threading architecture
- Enhanced complexity metrics

---

## Phase 3: DFG Generator Rewrite ⏳ PLANNED

### Objective
Implement SSA form with phi nodes and proper variable scoping for Elixir semantics.

### Key Changes Needed
- SSA variable versioning system
- Phi node generation at scope merges
- Proper Elixir variable scoping semantics
- Functional state threading

---

## Phase 4: CPG Integration ⏳ PLANNED

### Objective
Build unified representation that correlates AST, CFG, and DFG nodes.

### Key Changes Needed
- Cross-graph node correlation
- Unified query interface
- Pattern detection capabilities
- Performance optimization indexes

---

## Phase 5: Testing & Validation ⏳ PLANNED

### Objective
Implement validation framework and update tests to match new implementations.

### Key Changes Needed
- Research-based validation framework
- Updated test expectations
- Performance benchmarking
- Regression testing

---

## Technical Decisions Made

### Data Structure Architecture
- **CFG**: Enhanced with complexity metrics, path analysis, scope hierarchy
- **DFG**: SSA-based with variable versioning, phi nodes, comprehensive scoping
- **CPG**: Unified representation with cross-references and query indexes

### Algorithm Choices
- **CFG Complexity**: Decision points method (McCabe for functional languages)
- **DFG Variables**: SSA form with phi nodes at scope merges
- **State Management**: Purely functional with immutable state threading

### Elixir Semantics Handling
- **Pattern Matching**: New variable bindings within scope, SSA versioning
- **Guard Clauses**: Each guard adds +1 complexity, conditional flow edges
- **Pipe Operations**: Sequential data flow with intermediate value tracking

## Current Status

**Overall Progress**: 15% (Data structures complete, generators need updates)
**Current Phase**: Phase 1 - Foundation Stabilization
**Current Task**: Data Structure Migration
**Next Milestone**: Complete CFG data structure replacement

**Test Status**:
- Working Components: ~100% pass rate (Repository, Runtime Correlator, etc.)
- Broken Components: 5-25% pass rate (CFG, DFG, CPG generators)
- Target: 95%+ pass rate across all components

**Performance Targets**:
- CFG Generation: <100ms (current: failing)
- DFG Analysis: <200ms (current: failing)  
- CPG Building: <500ms (current: failing)
- Memory Usage: <1MB per module (current: unknown)

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks
1. **Breaking Working Components** - Mitigation: Incremental changes, comprehensive testing
2. **Test Compatibility** - Mitigation: Update tests alongside implementations
3. **Performance Regression** - Mitigation: Benchmark before/after changes
4. **Integration Issues** - Mitigation: Maintain EventStore wrapper, test integration points

### Rollback Strategy
- Keep original implementations in backup branches
- Incremental deployment with feature flags
- Comprehensive test coverage before replacement
