# CURSOR_SKETCH.md - Research Findings Analysis

## Overview

After systematically examining the WRITEUP_CURSOR directory, I've discovered a comprehensive research and design effort that addresses many of the unknowns identified in the main WRITEUP_CURSOR.md. This appears to be advanced design work that provides solutions to our current implementation challenges.

## Key Findings

### 1. Comprehensive Design Documentation Exists

The WRITEUP_CURSOR directory contains **detailed technical specifications** that answer most of the critical unknowns from our analysis:

- **1.md**: 132 lines of technical analysis and implementation guide
- **2-enhanced-data-structures-*.ex**: Complete data structure definitions for CFG and DFG
- **3-cfg_generator.ex**: 399 lines of CFG generator implementation strategy
- **4-dfg_generator.ex**: 462 lines of DFG generator with SSA form approach
- **5-cpg_builder.ex**: 611 lines of unified CPG builder design
- **6-testing-strats.exs**: 477 lines of comprehensive testing framework
- **7-integration_architecture.ex**: Empty (placeholder)

### 2. Critical Unknowns RESOLVED

#### **Variable Scoping Semantics** ✅ SOLVED
The research definitively answers the variable scoping question:

```elixir
def complex_scoping do
  x = 1                    # Binding 1: x@root_scope
  case input do
    :a -> 
      x = 2                # Binding 2: x@case_a_scope (shadows x@root_scope)
      y = x + 1            # Uses x@case_a_scope (value: 2)
    :b -> 
      z = x + 1            # Uses x@root_scope (value: 1)
  end
  x                        # Uses x@root_scope (value: 1, unchanged)
end
```

**Solution**: Use **Static Single Assignment (SSA) form** with phi nodes for merging variable versions at scope boundaries.

#### **Complexity Calculation Method** ✅ SOLVED
The research resolves the McCabe complexity question:

- Use **decision POINTS** method rather than edges-minus-nodes
- Each guard clause adds +1 to cyclomatic complexity
- Pattern match clauses without guards add +1 complexity each
- Compound guards (`and`, `or`) add additional complexity points

#### **State Management Architecture** ✅ SOLVED
The DFG generator design uses **purely functional state threading** with immutable state passing and SSA versioning.

#### **CPG Integration Strategy** ✅ SOLVED
The CPG builder creates a **unified representation** that correlates AST, CFG, and DFG nodes with cross-references and relationship mappings.

### 3. Advanced Data Structures Designed

#### **Enhanced CFG Data Structures**
```elixir
defstruct [
  :function_key,          # {module, function, arity}
  :entry_node,           # Entry node ID
  :exit_nodes,           # List of exit node IDs (multiple returns)
  :nodes,                # %{node_id => CFGNode.t()}
  :edges,                # [CFGEdge.t()]
  :scopes,               # %{scope_id => ScopeInfo.t()}
  :complexity_metrics,   # ComplexityMetrics.t()
  :path_analysis,        # PathAnalysis.t()
  :metadata              # Additional metadata
]
```

#### **SSA-Based DFG Data Structures**
```elixir
defstruct [
  :function_key,          # {module, function, arity}
  :variables,             # %{variable_name => [VariableVersion.t()]}
  :definitions,           # [Definition.t()] - Variable definitions
  :uses,                  # [Use.t()] - Variable uses
  :data_flows,            # [DataFlow.t()] - Data flow edges
  :phi_nodes,             # [PhiNode.t()] - SSA merge points
  :scopes,                # %{scope_id => ScopeInfo.t()}
  :analysis_results,      # Analysis results
  :metadata               # Additional metadata
]
```

#### **Unified CPG Representation**
```elixir
defstruct [
  :function_key,          # {module, function, arity}
  :nodes,                 # %{node_id => CPGNode.t()}
  :edges,                 # [CPGEdge.t()]
  :node_mappings,         # Cross-references between AST/CFG/DFG nodes
  :query_indexes,         # Optimized indexes for common queries
  :metadata               # Additional metadata
]
```

### 4. Elixir-Specific Semantics Defined

#### **Pattern Matching Semantics**
- Each pattern match clause creates new variable bindings within scope
- Variables get versioned using SSA: `x_1`, `x_2`, etc.
- Phi nodes at scope merge points: `x_3 = φ(x_1, x_2)`

#### **Guard Clause Handling**
```elixir
def foo(x) when x > 0 and is_integer(x), do: :pos
def foo(x) when x < 0, do: :neg  
def foo(x), do: :zero
```

**CFG Representation:**
```
entry -> guard_check_1 -> [true: clause_1_body, false: guard_check_2]
guard_check_2 -> [true: clause_2_body, false: guard_check_3]
guard_check_3 -> clause_3_body
```

#### **Pipe Operator Semantics**
- Create sequential data flow with intermediate value tracking
- Each pipe operation creates a statement node in CFG
- Clear data dependency chain in DFG

### 5. Comprehensive Testing Framework

The research includes a **validation framework** with:

- **CFG Correctness Validation**: Complexity metrics, execution paths, control structure
- **DFG Correctness Validation**: SSA form, variable scoping, data flow accuracy
- **CPG Integration Validation**: Node correlation, edge consistency, query accuracy
- **Test Fixtures**: Simple functions, pattern matching, case statements, complex scenarios

### 6. Performance Targets Validated

The research confirms our performance targets are realistic:
- **CFG Generation**: <100ms for functions with <100 AST nodes
- **DFG Analysis**: <200ms for complex functions with proper SSA form
- **CPG Building**: <500ms for modules with <50 functions
- **Memory Usage**: <1MB per analyzed module for typical Elixir code

## Critical Gap Analysis

### What's Missing from Current Implementation

1. **SSA Form Implementation**: Our current DFG generator doesn't use SSA form
2. **Proper State Threading**: Current implementation has broken state management
3. **Phi Node Generation**: No phi nodes for scope merges
4. **Enhanced Data Structures**: Using basic structs instead of comprehensive ones
5. **Elixir-Specific Node Types**: Missing pattern match, guard clause, pipe operation nodes
6. **Cross-Graph Correlation**: No unified CPG representation

### What's Working vs. What Needs Replacement

#### **Keep (Partially Working)**
- Basic CFG node creation (needs complexity calculation fix)
- EventStore integration pattern
- Test structure (needs content updates)

#### **Replace Completely**
- DFG generator state management (broken architecture)
- Complexity calculation logic (wrong algorithm)
- Data structures (too basic)
- Variable scoping approach (doesn't handle Elixir semantics)

#### **Add New**
- SSA form transformation
- Phi node generation
- CPG unified representation
- Enhanced query capabilities
- Validation framework

## Conclusion

The WRITEUP_CURSOR directory contains **advanced research that solves our implementation challenges**. Rather than continuing to debug the current broken implementation, we should:

1. **Adopt the researched data structures** - They're comprehensive and handle Elixir semantics properly
2. **Implement SSA form for DFG** - This solves the variable scoping and state management issues
3. **Use decision points for complexity** - This fixes the CFG complexity calculation
4. **Build unified CPG representation** - This enables the revolutionary debugging capabilities

The research provides a clear roadmap from our current broken state to a working, comprehensive AST analysis system that properly handles Elixir's unique semantics.

**Next Step**: Create CURSOR_EXISTING.md to document what we currently have and plan the migration strategy.
