### LAYER 6 STATUS DEEP DIVE

**What IS being validated:**

1.  **Logical Correctness of Distributed Components:** The core logic of `NodeCoordinator` (discovery, partition detection via `Node.ping`), `GlobalClock` (timestamp generation and updates from remote simulated nodes), and `EventSynchronizer` (RPC calls to exchange event data, delta sync logic, storing remote events) is being exercised.
2.  **RPC Integration:** The ability of ElixirScope components to correctly use `:rpc.call` and `:rpc.cast` to interact with their counterparts on other (simulated) nodes.
3.  **Data (De)Serialization over RPC:** Events and other data structures are implicitly tested for correct serialization and deserialization when passed via RPC.
4.  **Correlation ID Propagation (Simulated):** The tests check if correlation IDs can be maintained and associated correctly across operations that involve RPC calls between these local nodes.
5.  **Eventual Consistency (Simulated):** The `EventSynchronizer` tests verify that, after simulated partitions or normal operation, event data eventually propagates to all connected (simulated) nodes.
6.  **Basic Concurrency (Local):** The tests run multiple Erlang nodes, each with its own schedulers, so there's a degree of concurrency being tested, albeit on a single OS.

**What is NOT (or is poorly) validated:**

1.  **True Network Issues:**
    *   **Latency:** Real network latency is not a factor. Local loopback communication is extremely fast.
    *   **Packet Loss/Corruption:** These conditions are not simulated.
    *   **Network Partitions (Real):** A `Node.disconnect` is a clean, signaled disconnect. A real network partition (e.g., switch failure, firewall block) can be messier, leading to one-way communication, timeouts, etc. The tests don't cover the full spectrum of "netsplit" scenarios.
    *   **Bandwidth Constraints:** Real network bandwidth limits are not tested.
2.  **Physical Clock Skew:** While `GlobalClock` aims to be a Hybrid Logical Clock, its physical component adjustment is tested against other local clocks, not against significant, real-world physical clock drift between separate machines.
3.  **Heterogeneous Environments:** If nodes were on different operating systems, hardware, or Erlang/Elixir patch versions, new issues could arise. This isn't tested.
4.  **Real-World Distributed Erlang Setup/Ops:** Issues related to Erlang cookies, `epmd` (Erlang Port Mapper Daemon), firewall configurations, DNS resolution for node names across a real network are entirely bypassed in a local simulation.
5.  **Scalability Under True Network Load:** The performance tests measure local RPC and processing. They don't reflect how the system would scale if, for instance, `EventSynchronizer` had to pull large event batches over a slower, less reliable WAN link.
6.  **Failure Modes Specific to Distributed Systems:** Certain classes of Byzantine failures or complex race conditions that only manifest under specific network timings or partial system failures are very hard to reproduce and test reliably in a local simulation.

**More Accurate Statement for Layer 6 Status:**

| Layer | Component           | Status      | Test Coverage                                                                | Notes                                                                                                                                  |
| :---- | :------------------ | :---------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **6** | Distributed Systems | ✅ **Code Complete** | **Simulated Multi-node Tests Pass** (verifies distributed logic locally) | Hybrid logical clocks; **Real-world network conditions & true partition resilience not validated in single-VM dev.** |
