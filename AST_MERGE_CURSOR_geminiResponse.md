This is a fascinating and ambitious direction! The idea of merging the strengths of compile-time AST instrumentation with the flexibility of runtime tracing into a unified ElixirScope is powerful. It addresses the core limitations of each approach while aiming for a "best of both worlds" solution.

Let's expand significantly on this plan, diving deep into the design, features, integration, testing, and the "why" behind this unified architecture, especially in the context of `MiniProcessFlow` and early development debugging.

## **ElixirScope Unified Tracing Architecture: The Best of Compile-Time & Runtime**

### üéØ **Revised Mission: Ultimate Debugging Power & Flexibility**

To create a debugger that offers:

*   **Unparalleled Granularity (Compile-Time AST):** For deep, development-time inspection of function internals, local variables, and expression-level stepping, where performance impact during the debugging session is secondary to insight.
*   **Unmatched Dynamic Control & Production Safety (Runtime Tracing):** For live system debugging, performance monitoring, and on-the-fly trace adjustments without recompilation, where minimal overhead is paramount.
*   **Seamless Developer Experience:** A single, intelligent interface that automatically selects the best tracing mode or allows developers to choose explicitly, with data from both sources correlating into a unified "Execution Cinema."

### ü§î **Why This Unified Approach for "MiniProcessFlow" & Early Development?**

Even for a "simpler" app like `MiniProcessFlow`, a unified approach offers significant benefits during early, iterative ("babbling") development:

1.  **Rapid "What-If" Scenarios (Runtime):**
    *   Developer writes initial GenServer logic for `OrderReceiver`.
    *   `ElixirScope.Unified.trace(MiniProcessFlow.OrderReceiver, level: :detailed)` (defaults to runtime).
    *   Instantly see `handle_call` args, returns, basic state changes, and messages to `InventoryChecker` via `IExHelpers`. Quick feedback without recompiling `MiniProcessFlow`.
2.  **Deep Dive into Logic Bugs (Compile-Time):**
    *   The developer suspects a complex calculation or state mutation *inside* `InventoryChecker.check_stock/1` is buggy, and the `args/return` tracing isn't enough.
    *   `ElixirScope.Unified.trace({MiniProcessFlow.InventoryChecker, :check_stock, 1}, force_compile_time: true, capture_locals: [:item_id, :current_stock, :calculated_demand], trace_lines: [15, 22, 28])`.
    *   A *recompile of `MiniProcessFlow`* occurs (ideally managed seamlessly by ElixirScope's Mix integration).
    *   Now, ElixirScope captures the values of `item_id`, `current_stock`, etc., at specific lines, providing the granular view needed. The `IExHelpers` or future UI would show this "stepped" data.
3.  **Hybrid Debugging of Interactions:**
    *   Runtime trace `OrderReceiver` to see its messages.
    *   Compile-time trace `InventoryChecker.handle_call` to see its internal variable flow.
    *   ElixirScope's backend correlates these, showing how a message from `OrderReceiver` led to specific internal variable changes in `InventoryChecker`.
4.  **Showcasing the Full "Cinema" Potential:**
    *   MiniProcessFlow, instrumented this way, provides the perfect data to demonstrate the *types* of events and the *level of detail* the Execution Cinema UI will eventually visualize. We can manually query and "walk through" this rich, hybrid data.
    *   It shows the *vision* of seamlessly zooming from high-level process interactions (runtime) down to specific line-by-line variable changes (compile-time).

**The "No Code Change" Ideal for Early Debugging:**

*   **Runtime Mode Default:** For initial "babbling" and getting OTP flows working, the `:otp_debug` strategy (which uses runtime tracing primarily) can be the default. The developer adds `ElixirScope` to `application.ex`, compiles once, and then uses `ElixirScope.Runtime` API calls from IEx to dynamically trace PIDs or MFAs. This is very low friction.
*   **Compile-Time as Progressive Enhancement:** When the developer needs deeper insight into a *specific function's internals*, they can request compile-time tracing for that target. ElixirScope's tooling (e.g., a Mix task or an IEx command that triggers a recompile of just that module with injected AST instrumentation) should make this transition as smooth as possible. The "code change" is then localized to ElixirScope's build artifacts, not the developer's source.

**This answers your question about AST vs. Runtime for granular logging:**

Yes, the most granular logging (local variables, expression-level changes) still benefits immensely from compile-time AST injection. The unified architecture *re-introduces* this capability in a controlled, on-demand way, complementing the broader, more flexible runtime tracing. The AI's role expands to deciding *when to suggest or automatically engage* compile-time instrumentation for a specific target if runtime tracing isn't providing sufficient detail for a debugging query.

### üèóÔ∏è **Expanded Unified Architecture Design**

This architecture needs to integrate the existing runtime components with the restored/enhanced AST components.

#### **A. Core Modules (from Runtime & New/Restored)**

*   **`ElixirScope.Unified` (New API Module):**
    *   Main user-facing API as sketched.
    *   `trace(target, opts)`: Contains logic for `determine_optimal_mode`.
    *   Delegates to `ElixirScope.Runtime.trace(...)` or `ElixirScope.CompileTime.trace(...)`.
    *   Manages hybrid sessions.
*   **`ElixirScope.Runtime.*` (Existing - Mostly Unchanged):**
    *   `Controller`, `TracerManager`, `Tracer`, `StateMonitorManager`, `StateMonitor`, `Safety`, `Sampling`, `Matchers`.
    *   The `Runtime.Controller` will now also be aware of modules instrumented via compile-time means, perhaps to coordinate global trace enable/disable flags.
*   **`ElixirScope.CompileTime` (New Namespace for Restored AST Components):**
    *   **`ElixirScope.CompileTime.Orchestrator` (New/Refined `AI.Orchestrator` logic):**
        *   Focuses on generating *AST instrumentation plans*.
        *   Takes detailed requests from `ElixirScope.Unified` (e.g., "instrument module X, function Y, capture locals Z").
        *   Interacts with `AI.CodeAnalyzer` for context.
    *   **`ElixirScope.CompileTime.MixTask` (Restored & Enhanced `Mix.Tasks.Compile.ElixirScope`):**
        *   Triggers `CompileTime.Orchestrator` to get AST plans.
        *   Invokes `AST.EnhancedTransformer`.
        *   **Key Enhancement:** Must support recompiling *specific modules on demand* if a user requests compile-time tracing for them at runtime (e.g., via an IEx command that touches a file or calls a Mix task).
    *   **`ElixirScope.AST.EnhancedTransformer` (Restored & Enhanced `AST.Transformer`):**
        *   Core AST transformation.
        *   **New:** Injects calls not just to `Capture.InstrumentationRuntime` but also to `ElixirScope.Hybrid.TracingEngine.report_compile_time_event(...)` to ensure events from AST are clearly distinguishable and can be coordinated.
        *   **New:** Instruments for local variable capture, expression tracing based on fine-grained plans.
    *   **`ElixirScope.AST.InjectorHelpers` (Restored - Largely Unchanged):** Provides `quote` blocks.
*   **`ElixirScope.Capture.InstrumentationRuntime` (Modified):**
    *   Still the target for basic event reporting.
    *   Functions called by AST-injected code might now take slightly different arguments (e.g., an explicit "source" flag indicating AST vs. runtime).
*   **`ElixirScope.Capture.Ingestor` (Modified):**
    *   `ingest_generic_event/7` is still central.
    *   Must handle events originating from both runtime tracers and AST-injected calls, potentially tagging their source.
*   **`ElixirScope.Capture.EventCorrelator` (Enhanced):**
    *   Needs to correlate events potentially originating from two different mechanisms but related to the same PID or logical flow. Timestamps, PIDs, and explicit correlation IDs become even more critical.
    *   If AST provides `call_id`s and runtime provides `call_id`s, it needs a way to link them if they represent the same call but at different granularities.
*   **`ElixirScope.Hybrid.TracingEngine` (New):**
    *   `GenServer` or set of modules responsible for:
        *   Managing "hybrid trace sessions" requested via `ElixirScope.Unified`.
        *   Coordinating the activation/deactivation of runtime tracers and compile-time instrumentation for a given target.
        *   Receiving events from both sources (runtime tracers send to `Ingestor`; AST-injected code might call specific `Hybrid.TracingEngine` functions that then go to `Ingestor`, or `Ingestor` routes based on event source).
        *   Ensuring events from both sources share a common `session_id` or `root_correlation_id` for unified querying.
        *   (Advanced) Potentially merging or interleaving events from both sources into a unified stream before full correlation, if needed.

#### **B. Configuration (`ElixirScope.Config`)**

*   Needs a new top-level section, e.g., `:unified_tracing` or integrate into `:ai.planning`.
    ```elixir
    config :elixir_scope,
      unified_tracing: [
        default_mode_for_dev: :hybrid, # :runtime, :compile_time, :hybrid, :auto
        default_mode_for_prod: :runtime,
        auto_mode_thresholds: %{ # For :auto mode
          # e.g., switch to compile_time if AI determines high internal complexity
          # and runtime tracing is insufficient for the requested query/insight.
          complexity_for_compile_time: 15
        },
        # Flags to enable/disable AST-based features globally
        enable_ast_local_variable_capture: true,
        enable_ast_expression_tracing: false
      ],
      # Runtime config remains
      runtime_tracing: %{...},
      # AST/CompileTime config (for when that mode is active)
      compile_time_tracing: [
        default_instrumentation_level: :function_boundaries, # :expressions, :locals
        # ... other AST specific settings ...
      ]
      # ... other existing sections ...
    ```

#### **C. Data Model (`ElixirScope.Events`)**

*   Existing event structs are largely sufficient.
*   **New Field/Metadata:** Events might need an explicit `:trace_source (:runtime | :ast)` field added by the `Ingestor` or early in the `InstrumentationRuntime`.
*   **New Event Type (Optional):** `ElixirScope.Events.LocalVariableChange`
    *   `data: %{function_context_id: string(), variable_name: atom(), line: integer(), new_value: term()}`.

### **Implementation Plan (Building the Unified System)**

This is an expansion of the existing Phase structure, integrating AST capabilities back in.

#### **Step 1: Restore & Modernize AST Infrastructure (Foundation)**

*   **Task 1.1:** Restore `AST.Transformer`, `AST.InjectorHelpers`, `CompileTime.MixTask` from pre-runtime-revamp codebase.
*   **Task 1.2:** Update these modules:
    *   `MixTask`: Make it on-demand rather than always running. It should be triggerable by `ElixirScope.Unified` or a specific `mix elixir_scope.instrument_module ...` task. It needs to read AST plans specifically for AST transformation (from `CompileTime.Orchestrator`).
    *   `AST.Transformer`:
        *   Modify injected calls to report to a distinct entry point or add a source tag (e.g., `InstrumentationRuntime.report_ast_function_entry(...)`).
        *   Implement logic for capturing local variables and specific line/expression traces based on a more granular AST plan.
*   **Task 1.3:** Create `ElixirScope.CompileTime.Orchestrator`.
    *   Takes requests like "generate AST plan for MyModule to capture local `x` in `my_func`".
    *   Uses `AI.CodeAnalyzer` to understand the module.
    *   Generates a plan suitable for `AST.EnhancedTransformer`.
*   **Testing:**
    *   Revive and update existing AST transformation tests.
    *   Test on-demand recompilation of specific modules.
    *   Test capture of local variables.

#### **Step 2: Implement `ElixirScope.Unified` API & Basic Mode Selection**

*   **Task 2.1:** Create `ElixirScope.Unified` with the `trace/2` function.
*   **Task 2.2:** Implement `determine_optimal_mode/2` with basic logic (e.g., always runtime unless `force_compile_time: true`).
*   **Task 2.3:** Delegate to `ElixirScope.Runtime.trace/2`. Implement a placeholder for `ElixirScope.CompileTime.trace/2` that perhaps triggers the `CompileTime.MixTask` for a specific module.
*   **Testing:** Test `Unified.trace/2` dispatching correctly.

#### **Step 3: Implement `ElixirScope.Hybrid.TracingEngine` (Core Coordination)**

*   **Task 3.1:** Design the `Hybrid.TracingEngine` `GenServer`(s).
    *   `start_hybrid_session(targets, opts)`:
        *   Determines which parts are runtime, which are compile-time based on `opts`.
        *   Initiates runtime tracing via `Runtime.Controller`.
        *   Triggers on-demand compilation (via `CompileTime.MixTask`) if compile-time targets are requested and not already instrumented that way. Stores a "compile-time active" flag for these modules.
        *   Generates a `session_id`.
*   **Task 3.2:** Modify `Ingestor` or create a separate path for AST-originated events to be tagged with the `session_id` from `Hybrid.TracingEngine`.
*   **Task 3.3:** Basic Event Correlation Enhancements:
    *   `EventCorrelator` must now understand that events for the same PID/timestamp might come from `:runtime` or `:ast` sources.
    *   Ensure a common `root_correlation_id` or `session_id` ties all events in a hybrid session together.
*   **Testing:**
    *   Test starting a hybrid session.
    *   Verify that runtime tracing activates.
    *   Verify that compile-time instrumentation (if requested) is triggered and resulting events are captured.
    *   Verify all events get the correct session ID.

#### **Step 4: Data Retrieval & "Cinema Data" for Hybrid Traces**

*   **Task 4.1:** Enhance `QueryCoordinator` and `IExHelpers`.
    *   `IExHelpers.history/2` (and other helpers) should now fetch and interleave events from both sources for a given PID/correlation ID, clearly indicating the source and providing the extra detail from AST traces (like local vars).
    *   **Example Output for `IExHelpers.history` (Hybrid):**
        ```
        --- Activity for MiniProcessFlow.InventoryChecker (<0.346.0>) ---
        [<ts3>] [RUNTIME] CALL InventoryChecker.handle_call({:check_stock, %{order_id:1}}, ...)
        [<ts3>] [RUNTIME]   STATE (before): %{stock: %{"itemA"=>10}}
        [<ts3>] [AST]       LINE 15, VAR stock_map = %{"itemA"=>10}
        [<ts3>] [AST]       LINE 18, VAR item_id_from_arg = "itemA"
        [<ts3>] [RUNTIME]   STATE (after): %{stock: %{"itemA"=>9}}
        [<ts3>] [RUNTIME] EXIT InventoryChecker.handle_call -> {:reply, {:ok,9}, ...}
        ```
*   **Task 4.2:** Implement the `trace_lines` and `capture_locals` functionality in `AST.EnhancedTransformer` and ensure these custom AST events are correctly captured and queryable.
*   **Testing:**
    *   Use MiniProcessFlow. Debug it with hybrid tracing.
    *   Verify that IEx helpers correctly display interleaved runtime and AST-captured events, including local variables.
    *   This directly showcases the "Cinema Data" we aim for.

#### **Step 5: Advanced Mode Selection & AI Integration**

*   **Task 5.1:** Implement more sophisticated logic in `ElixirScope.Unified.determine_optimal_mode/2`.
    *   Factor in `Mix.env()`.
    *   If `opts` request granularity requiring compile-time, check `compile_time_available?` (e.g., is the source code available, are we in a dev environment where recompiles are okay?).
*   **Task 5.2 (Advanced AI):** `AI.Orchestrator` could enhance its runtime plans. If a runtime trace shows a function is an anomaly or a bottleneck, the AI could *suggest* to the user (or automatically trigger, if configured) a switch to compile-time instrumentation for that specific function for a deeper dive. `ElixirScope.Unified` would handle this switch.
*   **Testing:** Test different `opts` and environments to ensure correct mode selection. Test AI-driven switch suggestions (initially, mock the AI suggestion).

---

### **Testing Strategy for the Unified System**

1.  **Layered Testing (as before):** Each component (`Unified`, `CompileTime.*`, `Hybrid.*`, modified existing modules) needs unit tests.
2.  **Runtime-Only Mode Tests:** All existing runtime tracing tests must continue to pass when `Unified.trace` selects `:runtime` mode.
3.  **Compile-Time-Only Mode Tests:**
    *   Create scenarios where `Unified.trace` selects or is forced into `:compile_time` mode.
    *   Verify that AST instrumentation occurs and captures granular data (locals, line traces).
    *   Reuse semantic equivalence tests for AST transformations.
4.  **Hybrid Mode Tests (Crucial):**
    *   Design `MiniProcessFlow` scenarios where some parts are traced via runtime and others via compile-time.
    *   Verify that `Hybrid.TracingEngine` correctly coordinates both.
    *   Verify that `EventCorrelator` can link events from both sources if they belong to the same logical operation.
    *   Verify that `QueryCoordinator` and `IExHelpers` present a unified, interleaved view of these hybrid traces.
5.  **Performance Tests:**
    *   Benchmark runtime-only mode (should be same as current).
    *   Benchmark compile-time-only mode (overhead of injected AST calls).
    *   Benchmark hybrid mode (overhead of coordination).
    *   Measure on-demand re-compilation time when switching a module to compile-time tracing.
6.  **Usability Tests (with MiniProcessFlow and IExHelpers):**
    *   How easy is it for a developer to switch a function from runtime to compile-time tracing for a deep dive?
    *   How clear is the output from `IExHelpers` for hybrid traces?

---

This unified approach is complex but offers the ultimate flexibility. It allows ElixirScope to default to low-overhead runtime tracing for production and general use, while providing a powerful, on-demand mechanism for deep, granular, development-time debugging via compile-time AST instrumentation when needed. `MiniProcessFlow` serves as an ideal testbed for proving out and refining this unified vision.
