# ElixirScope Layer 2: Asynchronous Processing & Correlation - REFINED PLAN

## Current State Analysis (2024-01-26)

**Foundation Status**: ✅ **EXCELLENT** - Layer 1 achieved 98.2% success (216/220 tests passing)

### What We Have (Solid Foundation)
1. **Events System**: 37/37 tests ✅ - Complete event structures with serialization
2. **Ingestor System**: 21/21 tests ✅ - High-performance event ingestion  
3. **Storage System**: 32/32 tests ✅ - ETS-based storage with indexing
4. **Utils System**: 44/44 tests ✅ - Timestamps, IDs, data handling
5. **Application System**: 37/37 tests ✅ - Complete lifecycle management
6. **Ring Buffer**: 13/15 tests ✅ - Lock-free ring buffer (minor concurrency issues)

### Current Test Failures (4 failures to address)
1. **Config Performance** (2 tests): Configuration access/validation timing optimizations
2. **Ring Buffer Concurrency** (1 test): Race conditions in concurrent read/write 
3. **Ring Buffer Performance** (1 test): Batch read performance expectations
