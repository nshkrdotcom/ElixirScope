# ElixirScope - AI-Powered Execution Cinema Debugger

## Foundation Implementation Progress

### Project Vision
ElixirScope is an AI-powered debugging and observability platform for Elixir applications that provides "execution cinema" - a visual, time-travel debugging experience with total behavioral recall for concurrent and distributed Elixir systems.

### Foundation Layer Architecture (Phase 1)

## Testing Philosophy

Each layer must achieve 100% test coverage and pass all tests before proceeding to the next layer. Testing includes:

- **Unit Tests**: Individual module functionality
- **Property-Based Tests**: Edge cases and invariants
- **Integration Tests**: Cross-module interactions  
- **Performance Tests**: Speed and throughput requirements
- **Load Tests**: Behavior under stress
- **Layer Acceptance Tests**: End-to-end layer functionality

This methodical approach ensures a robust foundation for the advanced AI and visualization features in later phases.
