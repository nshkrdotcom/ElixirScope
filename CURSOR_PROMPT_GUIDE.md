## 🎯 **CURSOR AI CONTEXT SUMMARY**

You are implementing a **revolutionary hybrid architecture** for ElixirScope that combines **compile-time AST analysis** with **runtime execution correlation**. This is the world's first implementation of this approach in Elixir.

### **What You're Building:**
- **AST Repository** that stores compile-time structure with runtime correlation capabilities
- **Hybrid correlation system** that maps AST nodes to runtime events with <5ms latency
- **AI-enhanced analysis** that combines static code analysis with actual execution data
- **Time-travel debugging** capabilities through temporal event correlation

### **What You Have:**
- ✅ **90% complete AI/LLM infrastructure** (Gemini, Vertex AI, Mock providers)
- ✅ **95% complete capture pipeline** (InstrumentationRuntime, Ingestor, RingBuffer, EventCorrelator)
- ✅ **80% complete AST transformation** (Transformer, EnhancedTransformer, InjectorHelpers)
- ✅ **Comprehensive test infrastructure** (35 modules, 30 test files, 85% coverage)
- ✅ **Production-ready configuration and utilities**

### **What You Need to Create:**
- 🚧 **AST Repository system** (12 new modules)
- 🚧 **Runtime correlation bridge** (enhance existing + 3 new modules)
- 🚧 **Hybrid LLM integration** (5 new modules)
- 🚧 **Temporal storage system** (2 new modules)

## 🏗️ **IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY FOR CURSOR**

### **Core Principle: EVOLUTIONARY, NOT REVOLUTIONARY**
- **Build ON the existing foundation** - don't replace it
- **Enhance existing modules** before creating new ones
- **Maintain 100% backward compatibility** during implementation
- **Test every enhancement** to ensure existing functionality preserved

### **Implementation Order (Critical for Success):**
1. **Week 1**: AST Repository Core + Runtime Correlation Bridge
2. **Week 2**: Temporal Storage + Enhanced Event Processing  
3. **Week 3**: Hybrid LLM Integration + Context Building
4. **Week 4**: Integration Testing + Performance Optimization

## 🔧 **ERROR HANDLING & DEBUGGING PROMPTS**

### **Error Handling Pattern**
```
When implementing any new module, follow this error handling pattern used throughout ElixirScope:

1. Use {:ok, result} | {:error, reason} return tuples
2. Provide graceful degradation when hybrid features are disabled
3. Log errors using existing logging infrastructure
4. Include correlation metadata in error messages for debugging
5. Maintain system stability even when AST correlation fails
6. Provide meaningful error messages for developers

Example error handling pattern:

```elixir
def correlate_event(event) do
  case validate_event(event) do
    {:ok, validated_event} ->
      case perform_correlation(validated_event) do
        {:ok, result} -> {:ok, result}
        {:error, :correlation_timeout} -> 
          Logger.warn("AST correlation timeout for event #{event.id}")
          {:error, :correlation_timeout}
        {:error, reason} -> 
          Logger.error("AST correlation failed: #{inspect(reason)}")
          {:error, reason}
      end
    {:error, :invalid_event} ->
      Logger.warn("Invalid event structure: #{inspect(event)}")
      {:error, :invalid_event}
  end
end
```
```

### **Debugging Integration Prompt**
```
When debugging integration issues, check these integration points:

1. Configuration compatibility - ensure new config merges properly with existing
2. Storage integration - verify AST data stores alongside existing event data
3. Event flow - confirm events flow through existing pipeline with AST enhancements
4. Memory usage - monitor for memory leaks in correlation indexes
5. Performance impact - validate <10% overhead on existing functionality

Use existing debugging utilities:
- ElixirScope.Utils for common debugging helpers
- Existing test fixtures in test/fixtures/ for realistic test data
- Performance monitoring patterns from existing benchmarks
```

## 🚨 **CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES**

### **NEVER Do These Things:**
1. **Don't modify existing function signatures** - always add new functions alongside
2. **Don't break existing tests** - enhance functionality while preserving backward compatibility
3. **Don't ignore performance requirements** - every enhancement must meet latency targets
4. **Don't create circular dependencies** - maintain clean module separation
5. **Don't skip error handling** - every new function needs comprehensive error handling
6. **Don't hardcode values** - use existing configuration system

### **ALWAYS Do These Things:**
1. **Use existing patterns** - follow established ElixirScope patterns and conventions
2. **Test extensively** - create tests before or alongside implementation
3. **Document integration points** - explain how new modules connect to existing infrastructure
4. **Validate performance** - benchmark every new feature
5. **Handle edge cases** - consider what happens when correlation fails
6. **Maintain compatibility** - ensure existing functionality works unchanged
