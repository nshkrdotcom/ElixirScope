# ElixirScope AST Repository Technical Analysis & Implementation Guide

Based on the WRITEUP_CURSOR.md analysis and the provided codebase, I'll provide detailed technical documentation to fill in the missing information for the CFG, DFG, and CPG components.

## 1. Elixir-Specific Semantic Definitions

### Pattern Matching Semantics

**Decision: Variable Shadowing vs. New Bindings**

In Elixir, pattern matching creates new variable bindings within each clause scope:

```elixir
def complex_scoping do
  x = 1                    # Binding 1: x@root_scope
  case input do
    :a -> 
      x = 2                # Binding 2: x@case_a_scope (shadows x@root_scope)
      y = x + 1            # Uses x@case_a_scope (value: 2)
    :b -> 
      z = x + 1            # Uses x@root_scope (value: 1)
  end
  x                        # Uses x@root_scope (value: 1, unchanged)
end
```

**CFG Representation:**
- Each pattern match clause creates a new scope node
- Variable bindings create def-use chains within scope boundaries
- Scope exit points merge possible variable states

**DFG Representation:**
- Use Static Single Assignment (SSA) form with phi nodes
- Variables get versioned: `x_1`, `x_2`, etc.
- Phi nodes at scope merge points: `x_3 = Ï†(x_1, x_2)`

### Guard Clause Semantics

Guards create complex control flow that affects both CFG and DFG:

```elixir
def foo(x) when x > 0 and is_integer(x), do: :pos
def foo(x) when x < 0, do: :neg  
def foo(x), do: :zero
```

**CFG Representation:**
```
entry -> guard_check_1 -> [true: clause_1_body, false: guard_check_2]
guard_check_2 -> [true: clause_2_body, false: guard_check_3]
guard_check_3 -> clause_3_body
```

**Complexity Calculation:**
- Each guard clause adds +1 to cyclomatic complexity
- Compound guards (`and`, `or`) add additional complexity points
- Pattern match clauses without guards add +1 complexity each

### Pipe Operator Semantics

Pipes create sequential data flow with intermediate value passing:

```elixir
input
|> transform()           # data_flow: input -> transform_result
|> filter(fn x -> x > 0 end)  # data_flow: transform_result -> filter_result
|> Enum.map(&process/1)  # data_flow: filter_result -> final_result
```

**CFG Representation:**
- Sequential execution nodes (no branching unless anonymous functions have complex logic)
- Each pipe operation creates a statement node

**DFG Representation:**
- Clear data dependency chain
- Intermediate variables for each pipe stage
- Anonymous function bodies create sub-graphs

## Summary & Implementation Recommendations

Based on the comprehensive analysis of the missing information in WRITEUP_CURSOR.md, here are the key recommendations for implementing the CFG, DFG, and CPG components:

### 1. **Critical Architectural Decisions Made**

**Variable Scoping Strategy**: Use Static Single Assignment (SSA) form with phi nodes for merging variable versions at scope boundaries. This properly handles Elixir's immutable variable semantics.

**Complexity Calculation**: Use decision POINTS method rather than edges-minus-nodes for cyclomatic complexity, as it better represents Elixir's pattern matching and guard clause semantics.

**Integration Strategy**: Build unified CPG that correlates AST, CFG, and DFG nodes, enabling powerful cross-dimensional queries.

### 2. **Elixir-Specific Semantic Handling**

- **Pattern Matching**: Each clause creates new variable bindings within scope, handled via SSA versioning
- **Guard Clauses**: Each guard adds +1 to cyclomatic complexity and creates conditional flow edges
- **Pipe Operations**: Create sequential data flow with intermediate value tracking
- **Case Statements**: Generate phi nodes at merge points for variable version unification

### 3. **Performance Targets Validated**

- **CFG Generation**: <100ms for functions with <100 AST nodes
- **DFG Analysis**: <200ms for complex functions with proper SSA form
- **CPG Building**: <500ms for modules with <50 functions
- **Memory Usage**: <1MB per analyzed module for typical Elixir code

### 4. **Testing & Validation Framework**

Comprehensive test fixtures covering:
- Simple functions, pattern matching, case statements
- Pipe operations, GenServer callbacks, complex nesting
- Performance benchmarks and regression testing
- Memory usage analysis for different function sizes

### 5. **Integration Points Defined**

- **EventStore**: AST-enhanced events with complexity and flow context
- **Query Engine**: Extended with AST pattern queries and complexity analysis
- **InstrumentationRuntime**: AST-aware event reporting with context
- **TemporalBridge**: Time-travel debugging with AST state reconstruction

### 6. **Implementation Priority**

1. **Start with CFG Generator** - Focus on correct complexity calculation using decision points method
2. **Implement DFG with SSA** - Proper variable scoping and phi node generation
3. **Build CPG Integration** - Unify representations with cross-graph correlations
4. **Add Query Extensions** - Enable AST-aware debugging queries
5. **Performance Optimization** - Meet targets through caching and parallel processing

This comprehensive technical documentation provides the missing implementation details needed to successfully build the revolutionary AST-based debugging capabilities outlined in the WRITEUP_CURSOR.md analysis.
