You're in a common, tricky spot! It's good that you're recognizing this *before* diving deep into the CPG algorithmic enhancements.

Let's break down the situation based on the test files you've shared:

**What the Existing Tests Seem to Cover (and What They Imply):**

*   **AI Layer (`ai/`):** These tests seem to focus on the *behavior* of your AI components (LLM client, code analyzer, predictor) often using mocks or testing their internal logic rather than deep integration with a fully correct CPG. This is somewhat decoupled.
*   **AST Transformation (`ast/`):** Tests for `Transformer` and `EnhancedTransformer` likely ensure that ASTs are modified in expected ways to inject instrumentation calls. This is crucial but doesn't guarantee the *runtime data* generated by those calls is perfectly correlated or that the *static analysis components* (like CPG builder) correctly interpret the original or transformed AST.
*   **AST Repository - Core (`ast_repository/repository_test.exs`, `enhanced_repository_test.exs`, `memory_manager_test.exs`, `query_builder_test.exs`):**
    *   These test the basic CRUD operations for storing and retrieving `ModuleData`, `FunctionData`, `EnhancedModuleData`, `EnhancedFunctionData`.
    *   `MemoryManager` tests likely focus on its direct API (cleanup, compression calls).
    *   `QueryBuilder` tests focus on constructing query specs and perhaps basic execution logic (often mocked).
    *   **Crucially, these tests might *not* be deeply validating the *content and correctness* of the CFG/DFG/CPG data *within* `EnhancedFunctionData` or `EnhancedModuleData` if those are just passed around as complex terms.**
*   **AST Repository - Parsers & Graphs (`cfg_generator_test.exs`, `dfg_generator_test.exs`, `cpg_builder_test.exs`, `parser_test.exs`, `parser_enhanced_test.exs`):**
    *   `Parser` tests likely ensure ASTs are traversed and node IDs are assigned (as seen in `parser_enhanced_test.exs`).
    *   `CFGGeneratorTest` and `DFGGeneratorTest` (and their `_enhanced_test` counterparts) are where the core graph generation logic is tested. **Your observation that these are "illustrative at best" is key.** If these tests only cover simple cases or don't assert deep structural properties of the generated CFGs/DFGs, then the foundation is indeed shaky.
    *   `CPGBuilderTest` would then test the unification of these potentially illustrative CFGs/DFGs. If the inputs are illustrative, the output CPG will be too.
*   **Capture Layer (`capture/`):** These tests ensure events are ingested, buffered, and written, often focusing on the mechanics of the capture pipeline rather than the semantic correctness of the *data within* the events (especially correlation IDs from AST).
*   **Compiler (`compiler/`):** `MixTaskTest` verifies the compile-time task runs and transforms files.
*   **File System (`file_watcher_test.exs`, `synchronizer_test.exs`, `project_populator_test.exs`):**
    *   `FileWatcherTest` checks if file system events are detected. Your note about its instability is important.
    *   `SynchronizerTest` and `ProjectPopulatorTest` ensure that files are processed and data is passed to the repository. Again, they might not deeply validate the *correctness* of the CFG/DFG/CPG generated during population.

**The Core Issue You're Spotting:**

Even if individual component tests pass (e.g., `CFGGeneratorTest` passes for a simple "if" statement, `EnhancedRepositoryTest` passes for storing a `EnhancedFunctionData` struct), the *integration and semantic correctness* of the generated CPG (which is the combination of AST, CFG, DFG) might be flawed or incomplete. Runtime errors appearing during CPG generation for slightly more complex code are a strong signal of this.

**Decision: Stabilize the Core CPG Foundation First.**

Yes, I still strongly recommend **prioritizing the stabilization and comprehensive testing of the current CPG generation pipeline (AST parsing -> CFG -> DFG -> CPG unification) before building the advanced algorithmic layer on top of it.**

Here's why this is critical, even if the CPG layer is "illustrative":

1.  **The "Illustrative" Code IS Your Foundation:** The advanced algorithms will consume the CPGs produced by this illustrative code. If those CPGs are structurally incorrect, incomplete for common Elixir constructs, or cause runtime errors during their own generation, the advanced layer will fail or produce garbage.
2.  **Debugging Will Be Misleading:** If you proceed, and an advanced algorithm gives a weird result, you'll waste time debugging the algorithm when the real issue might be a malformed CPG input.
3.  **Incremental Refactoring is Harder on a Moving Target:** While you'll refactor the CPG layer as you enhance it, refactoring an *already broken or incomplete* layer while adding new complexity on top is much harder than refactoring a *known, working (even if simple)* layer.
4.  **Test Debt Accumulates:** Pushing forward means the tests for the advanced layer will also be built on the assumption of a correct CPG. If that assumption is false, those tests become less meaningful.

**What "Stabilizing the Core CPG Foundation" Means in Practice (The Necessary Tests):**

This isn't about achieving 100% perfect CPGs for every esoteric Elixir feature immediately. It's about ensuring **robust and correct CPG generation for the common and essential Elixir constructs** that your advanced analyses will encounter.

Here's a focused list of tests needed *before* heavily investing in `CPGMath`, `CPGSemantics`, etc. This list focuses on validating the output of `CPGBuilder.build_cpg/2` (or its constituent parts like `CFGGenerator.generate_cfg/2` and `DFGGenerator.generate_dfg/1`).

This focused list should give you a much more stable CPG foundation. Once these tests are green and you're confident in the CPGs for common Elixir code, then proceeding with the "Comprehensive Merged Test List" for the algorithmic enhancements will be much more productive and reliable. The runtime errors you're seeing should be caught and fixed by implementing the tests in sections I-IV above.
