## 1. Introduction and Goals

### 1.1. Role of the Ring Buffer in ElixirScope

The Ring Buffer is a critical component in ElixirScope's event capture pipeline. Positioned between the `EventIngestor` and the `AsyncWriterPool`, its primary function is to act as a high-speed, temporary staging area for incoming trace events. This decouples the extremely fast event generation in instrumented application processes from the potentially slower asynchronous processing, correlation, and storage stages. This decoupling is essential for enabling ElixirScope's "total recall" vision while maintaining minimal performance overhead on the instrumented application.

### 1.2. Performance Requirements and Rationale for Lock-Free Metadata

The performance targets for the Ring Buffer are demanding:

*   **Write Latency:** Sub-microsecond average latency for writing a single event to the buffer.
*   **Throughput:** Capable of handling hundreds of thousands, ideally over a million, events per second under concurrent write load from multiple application processes.
*   **Bounded Memory:** Fixed-size to prevent unbounded memory growth.
*   **Concurrent Access:** Must safely support multiple producer processes (from the instrumented application via `Ingestor`) and multiple consumer processes (`AsyncWriter` workers) simultaneously.

Traditional lock-based approaches for managing shared data structures, such as serializing all access to buffer metadata (like write/read pointers) through a single `GenServer`, would introduce a significant bottleneck, failing to meet these performance requirements. Each event write would incur the overhead of message passing and serialized processing, fundamentally limiting throughput.

To overcome this, ElixirScope's Ring Buffer employs **lock-free techniques for managing its core metadata (pointers and counters)**. This allows multiple processes to attempt updates concurrently, leveraging hardware-level atomicity provided by the Erlang VM's `:atomics` module, thereby maximizing parallelism and minimizing contention for these critical shared variables.

## 2. Understanding "Lock-Free" Concurrency

### 2.1. Definition and Guarantees

A concurrent algorithm is **lock-free** if it guarantees system-wide progress. Specifically, if multiple threads (or processes, in the BEAM context, interacting with a shared resource) are attempting operations, at least one thread will complete its operation in a finite number of steps, regardless of the execution speed or potential suspension of other threads. This ensures the system as a whole does not stall indefinitely. Lock-freedom is a stronger guarantee than obstruction-freedom but weaker than wait-freedom (where every thread makes progress in a bounded number of its *own* steps).

### 2.2. Contrast with Lock-Based Concurrency

Lock-based concurrency relies on mutual exclusion mechanisms (mutexes, semaphores) to protect shared resources. While simpler to reason about in some cases, locks can lead to issues like:

*   **Deadlocks:** Circular dependencies where threads wait for locks held by each other.
*   **Livelocks:** Threads actively retry operations but fail to make progress due to repeated conflicts.
*   **Convoying:** A slow thread holding a lock delays all other threads needing that lock.
*   **Contention Overhead:** Acquiring and releasing locks introduces performance costs, especially under high contention.

Lock-free algorithms aim to avoid these problems by allowing concurrent operations to proceed, managing conflicts through atomic operations and often involving retry loops.

### 2.3. Atomic Primitives (e.g., Compare-And-Swap)

Lock-free algorithms typically depend on hardware-supported atomic instructions. The most common is **Compare-And-Swap (CAS)**. A CAS operation atomically:
1. Reads a value from a memory location.
2. Compares it with an expected value.
3. If they match, writes a new value to the location.
4. Returns an indication of success or failure (often the original value).

This allows a thread to attempt an update optimistically. If another thread modified the location in the interim (so the "expected" value no longer matches the current value), the CAS fails, and the first thread can retry its operation based on the new current value.

## 3. Lock-Free Principles in the BEAM/Elixir Context

### 3.1. BEAM's Native Concurrency Model (Actor Model, Message Passing)

The BEAM VM's concurrency is built on the actor model. Processes are lightweight, isolated entities with no shared memory by default. Communication occurs via asynchronous message passing, where messages are copied between process mailboxes. This model inherently prevents many data races and simplifies concurrent programming as developers typically don't manage locks for inter-process state.

### 3.2. Identifying Bottlenecks for Shared Data Structures

While the actor model is powerful, scenarios arise where a truly shared, high-performance data structure is needed. A Ring Buffer for event ingestion is such a case. If every instrumented application process had to send a message to a single `GenServer` managing the buffer's pointers to get a write slot, that `GenServer` would become the system's performance bottleneck, serializing all writes.

### 3.3. The `:atomics` Module: Enabling Lock-Free Operations on Shared Counters

Erlang/OTP provides the `:atomics` module, which is key to ElixirScope's lock-free Ring Buffer metadata management.
*   `atomics:new(Size, Opts)`: Creates a reference to a new fixed-size array of atomic counters, initialized to zero. These counters can be safely accessed and modified by any Erlang process.
*   `atomics:add(AtomicsRef, Pos, Incr)`: Atomically adds `Incr` to the counter at `Pos`.
*   `atomics:get(AtomicsRef, Pos)`: Atomically reads the counter at `Pos`.
*   `atomics:put(AtomicsRef, Pos, Value)`: Atomically sets the counter at `Pos` to `Value`.
*   `atomics:compare_exchange(AtomicsRef, Pos, Expected, Desired)`: This is the crucial CAS operation. It atomically compares the value at `Pos` with `Expected`. If they match, it sets the value at `Pos` to `Desired` and returns `:ok`. Otherwise, it returns `{:error, Actual}` where `Actual` is the current value at `Pos`.

These operations are performed at a level closer to hardware atomicity (managed by the BEAM runtime), providing a much lower-overhead mechanism for coordinating access to simple shared integers than message passing to a serializer process.

### 3.4. ETS Tables: Highly Concurrent Data Storage

Erlang Term Storage (ETS) tables are in-memory data stores accessible by multiple processes. ETS itself is highly optimized for concurrent access. Key ETS options relevant to the Ring Buffer include:
*   `:set` or `:ordered_set`: Table type. `:set` is used for the RingBuffer data as order is managed by pointers.
*   `:public`: Allows any process to access the table.
*   `:read_concurrency, true`: Optimizes for concurrent reads.
*   `:write_concurrency, true`: Optimizes for concurrent writes by using fine-grained locking internally (this does not mean ETS writes are "lock-free" in the strict CAS sense, but highly concurrent).

While ETS operations involve internal coordination mechanisms, they are significantly faster for shared data access than a single GenServer handling all data operations.

## 4. ElixirScope's Ring Buffer Architecture

As depicted in `DIAGS.md#5. Ring Buffer Implementation Detail`, the ElixirScope Ring Buffer consists of two main parts for its control plane and data plane.

### 4.1. Core Components

#### 4.1.1. Metadata Atomics Array

A small, fixed-size array managed by `:atomics.new/2` (e.g., size 5). Each index in this array holds a critical piece of metadata for the Ring Buffer:
*   `@write_pos` (Index 1): The next available slot index to write to. This continuously increases.
*   `@read_pos` (Index 2): The oldest slot index that has been written but not yet fully consumed or dropped (used primarily for the `:drop_oldest` strategy and calculating available events).
*   `@total_writes` (Index 3): A monotonically increasing counter of all successful write attempts.
*   `@total_reads` (Index 4): A monotonically increasing counter of all events successfully read (by all consumers).
*   `@dropped_events` (Index 5): A counter for events dropped due to overflow (in `:drop_oldest` mode).

These atomics are the core of the lock-free coordination.

#### 4.1.2. ETS-based Data Buffer

An ETS table (e.g., named `:elixir_scope_buffer_<unique_name>`, type `:set`) stores the actual event data.
*   **Keys:** The buffer index, calculated as `current_pointer_value &&& buffer.mask`.
*   **Values:** The serialized event data or the event struct itself.
The `buffer.mask` (which is `buffer.size - 1` for power-of-2 sizes) allows for efficient modulo operation via bitwise AND to wrap around the buffer.

### 4.2. Configuration Parameters

*   `:size`: The total number of slots in the buffer. Must be a power of 2.
*   `:mask`: Derived from `:size` (`size - 1`), used for index calculation.
*   `:overflow_strategy`: Determines behavior when the buffer is full (`:drop_oldest`, `:drop_newest`, `:block`).
*   `:atomics_ref`: The reference to the `:atomics` array for this buffer instance.
*   `:buffer_table`: The ETS table ID for this buffer instance.

## 5. Lock-Free Metadata Management

This is where the "lock-free" nature of the RingBuffer is most evident.

### 5.1. Write Pointer (`@write_pos`) Management

#### 5.1.1. Claiming a Write Slot (The `claim_write_position` Algorithm)

When a process (via `ElixirScope.Capture.Ingestor`) needs to write an event:
1.  It atomically reads the current `@write_pos` (`wp_current = :atomics.get(atomics_ref, @write_pos)`).
2.  It atomically reads the current `@read_pos` (`rp_current = :atomics.get(atomics_ref, @read_pos)`).
3.  It checks if the buffer is full: `if (wp_current - rp_current) >= buffer.size`.
    *   If full, it proceeds to overflow handling (see Section 7).
    *   If not full, it attempts to claim the `wp_current` slot.
4.  **Atomic Increment Attempt:** It uses `atomics:compare_exchange(atomics_ref, @write_pos, wp_current, wp_current + 1)`.
    *   If `atomics:compare_exchange` returns `:ok`, the process has successfully claimed the slot `wp_current`. It can now write its data to ETS index `wp_current &&& buffer.mask`. After writing, it atomically increments `@total_writes`.
    *   If `atomics:compare_exchange` returns `{:error, actual_wp}`, it means another process incremented `@write_pos` between the read (step 1) and the CAS attempt. The current process's `wp_current` is stale. The process must **retry** the entire sequence from step 1 with the `actual_wp` or by re-reading. This retry loop is fundamental to lock-free CAS-based algorithms.

#### 5.1.2. Use of `atomics:compare_exchange/4` for Atomicity

The `atomics:compare_exchange/4` is the cornerstone. It guarantees that the check for `wp_current` and the update to `wp_current + 1` happen as a single, indivisible operation. This prevents race conditions where multiple processes might read the same `@write_pos`, both try to write to the same slot, and then both increment the pointer, potentially leading to one of them overwriting the other or incorrect pointer values.

#### 5.1.3. Handling Contention and Retries

Under high contention (many processes trying to write simultaneously), CAS operations might fail more frequently, leading to more retries. This is inherent in lock-free designs. The performance of `:atomics` is such that these retries are generally very fast. The alternative, a lock, would cause queueing.

### 5.2. Read Pointer (`@read_pos`) Management

#### 5.2.1. Consumer-Specific Read Pointers

For multiple independent consumers (like the `AsyncWriter` workers), each consumer must maintain its *own* logical read position. The global `@read_pos` in the RingBuffer's atomics is primarily for:
*   Calculating available space (`@write_pos - @read_pos`).
*   Implementing the `:drop_oldest` overflow strategy.

When an `AsyncWriter` reads a batch, it does so from its *own* last known read position up to a certain number of events or up to the current global `@write_pos`. After successfully processing and persisting these events, it would then update its own local read position. The global `@read_pos` does not track individual consumer progress directly for data reads.

#### 5.2.2. Global Read Pointer for Dropping Oldest

In the `:drop_oldest` strategy, when the buffer is full and a new write comes in:
1.  The write operation atomically increments the global `@read_pos` using `atomics:add(atomics_ref, @read_pos, 1)`. This effectively discards the oldest event by making its slot available for overwriting.
2.  The `@dropped_events` counter is atomically incremented.
3.  The new write then proceeds as if a slot was free.

This ensures that even if consumers are slow, producers can continue writing by overwriting the oldest, unconsumed data.

### 5.3. Atomic Counters (`@total_writes`, `@total_reads`, `@dropped_events`)

These are simple counters used for statistics and monitoring. They are updated using `atomics:add(atomics_ref, counter_index, 1)`. This operation is atomic and highly efficient for concurrent increments.

## 6. Data Storage in ETS

### 6.1. ETS Table Configuration

The `:buffer_table` ETS table is configured typically as:
*   `type: :set`: Unordered, keys are unique. Efficient for direct lookup by index.
*   `access: :public`: Writable by any process (necessary for producers and for clearing by the buffer manager).
*   `read_concurrency: true`: Optimizes for concurrent read operations from multiple `AsyncWriter`s or other consumers.
*   `write_concurrency: true`: Optimizes for concurrent write operations from multiple producers (`EventIngestor` calls). ETS achieves this with internal, fine-grained locking or other concurrency control mechanisms, which means individual ETS writes are not necessarily "lock-free" in the CAS sense but are designed for high parallelism.

### 6.2. Interaction between Atomic Pointers and ETS Access

The lock-free management of `@write_pos` ensures that each producer process claims a unique logical buffer position. This logical position is then mapped to an ETS key using `index = claimed_position &&& buffer.mask`. The producer then performs an `:ets.insert(buffer_table, {index, event_data})`. Because each producer has a unique `claimed_position` (for that attempt), concurrent ETS inserts to *different* calculated `index` keys can proceed with high parallelism, subject to ETS's internal `write_concurrency` optimizations. If two processes, through the nature of the modulo, happen to target the same `index` (because one is wrapping around and overwriting an old slot just as another is writing to a new slot that hashes to the same index value), ETS's `:set` semantics mean the last write to that key wins, which is acceptable and consistent with the ring buffer model (new data overwrites old).

### 6.3. Concurrency Characteristics of ETS Writes/Reads

ETS is a mature, highly optimized component of OTP. With `write_concurrency` enabled, ETS can often handle many concurrent writes to different keys (or even the same key, with `:set` replacing the old value) very efficiently. The primary contention point that ElixirScope's RingBuffer aims to solve with `:atomics` is the *coordination of which slot to write to* (i.e., managing the `@write_pos`), not the ETS write itself.

## 7. Overflow Handling Strategies

When `claim_write_position` determines the buffer is full (`@write_pos - @read_pos >= buffer.size`), the configured `:overflow_strategy` dictates behavior:

### 7.1. `:drop_oldest`

1.  Atomically increment `@read_pos`: `atomics:add(atomics_ref, @read_pos, 1)`. This effectively marks the oldest slot as "free" or "consumable for overwrite."
2.  Atomically increment `@dropped_events`: `atomics:add(atomics_ref, @dropped_events, 1)`.
3.  The original write operation is then retried (which should now find space because `@read_pos` has advanced).
    *   **Consequence:** Data loss for the oldest event. Guarantees producers can always write (eventual consistency for consumers if they fall behind).

### 7.2. `:drop_newest`

1.  The `claim_write_position` function simply returns `{:error, :buffer_full}`.
2.  The `ElixirScope.Capture.Ingestor` (or the caller of `RingBuffer.write`) is responsible for handling this error, typically by dropping the incoming (newest) event.
3.  Atomically increment `@dropped_events`.
    *   **Consequence:** Data loss for the newest event if the buffer is full. Protects older data already in the buffer.

### 7.3. `:block` (and its implications)

1.  `claim_write_position` would return `{:error, :buffer_full}`.
2.  The current ElixirScope code seems to treat this similarly to `:drop_newest` at the `RingBuffer.write` level (returns `{:error, :buffer_full}`).
3.  A true `:block` strategy would require the calling process to wait (e.g., by sleeping and retrying, or using a more sophisticated backpressure mechanism). Implementing true blocking directly in the `RingBuffer.write` for all callers could stall application processes if consumers are too slow. This is why it often results in an error that higher layers must handle, potentially by signaling backpressure.
    *   **Consequence:** Can lead to producer processes stalling if consumers cannot keep up. Provides strongest data integrity if stalls are acceptable.

## 8. Read Operations

### 8.1. Single Event Read (`read/2`)

```elixir
def read(%__MODULE__{} = buffer, read_position \\ 0) do
  write_pos = :atomics.get(buffer.atomics_ref, @write_pos)
  
  if read_position < write_pos do // Check if there's data to read
    index = read_position &&& buffer.mask
    
    case :ets.lookup(buffer.buffer_table, index) do
      [{^index, event}] ->
        :atomics.add(buffer.atomics_ref, @total_reads, 1) // For global stats
        {:ok, event, read_position + 1} // Return event and *next* position for this reader
      [] -> :empty // Slot was overwritten or never written (should be rare if pointers are correct)
    end
  else
    :empty // Reader is caught up
  end
end
```
Each consumer (`AsyncWriter`) uses `read/2` (or `read_batch/3`) by passing its *own* current read position. The returned `new_position` is what that specific consumer should use for its next read.

### 8.2. Batch Event Read (`read_batch/3`)

`read_batch/3` is similar but reads multiple events:
1.  Reads current global `@write_pos`.
2.  Calculates number of available events for this consumer (`available = max(0, write_pos - start_position)`).
3.  Determines number to read (`to_read = min(count, available)`).
4.  Iterates from `start_position` to `start_position + to_read - 1`, calculating ETS `index` for each and looking up events.
5.  Atomically increments `@total_reads` by the number of events actually read.
6.  Returns the list of events and the consumer's new read position (`start_position + to_read`).

### 8.3. Ensuring Consistency Between Pointers and Data

*   The use of CAS for `@write_pos` ensures that a slot is claimed *before* data is written to ETS.
*   Consumers read up to the current `@write_pos`. There's a small window where `@write_pos` might be incremented, but the ETS insert for that slot might not be complete yet (though ETS inserts are generally very fast).
    *   If a consumer reads an index and finds it empty via `:ets.lookup` (even if `read_position < write_pos`), it correctly gets `:empty` or `nil` (for batch), which is handled. This scenario is rare but possible due to the slight delay between pointer increment and ETS write completion.
*   The overall design favors availability and speed for writers. "Eventually consistent" reads are acceptable for this type of event stream processing. Perfect consistency would require more coordination, reducing performance.

## 9. Performance Implications and Benchmarks

*   **Write Path:**
    *   `claim_write_position`: Few atomic reads, one atomic CAS. Extremely fast.
    *   `:ets.insert/2`: Highly optimized for concurrent writes.
    *   `atomics:add/3`: Fast.
    *   **Measured:** ElixirScope's `PROGRESS.md` claims `<1µs` for single event capture and further optimization with batching in `Ingestor` leading to `~242ns` effective write time per event in a batch. This confirms the lock-free metadata approach is highly effective.
*   **Read Path:**
    *   `atomics:get/2`: Fast.
    *   `:ets.lookup/2` or `:ets.select/2` (for batches, though current `read_batch` uses multiple lookups): Fast for existing keys.
    *   `atomics:add/3`: Fast.
*   **Comparison with `GenServer`-based Pointer Management:**
    *   A `GenServer` would serialize all pointer access.
    *   Overhead per access: message send + context switch + `GenServer` loop logic + message reply (for calls). This would likely be tens of microseconds at best, orders of magnitude slower than direct `:atomics` operations, making it unsuitable for the target throughput.

## 10. Trade-offs and Considerations

### 10.1. Complexity of Lock-Free Logic

While `:atomics` simplifies things compared to C++/Java lock-free implementations, reasoning about concurrent access and potential retry loops still adds complexity compared to a simple `GenServer` serializer. Careful testing (especially concurrency tests) is vital.

### 10.2. Interaction with BEAM Schedulers

Processes performing atomic operations can still be preempted by BEAM schedulers. However, the atomic operations themselves are guaranteed to be indivisible. The performance of `:atomics` is generally good because these operations are often mapped efficiently to underlying hardware capabilities by the BEAM runtime.

### 10.3. Limitations of `:atomics` (Fixed Size Array)

The `:atomics` array is fixed size upon creation. For ElixirScope's RingBuffer, this is not an issue as the number of metadata items (pointers, counters) is small and known upfront.

## 11. Conclusion

ElixirScope's Ring Buffer leverages **lock-free metadata management via the `:atomics` module** to achieve its high-performance event ingestion goals. This approach effectively bypasses the need for traditional Elixir-level locks or serializer processes for updating critical pointers and counters, allowing for highly concurrent writes from instrumented application processes.

The event data itself is stored in an ETS table, which provides its own robust, highly-concurrent access. The "lock-free" characteristic primarily applies to the *coordination logic* ensuring that processes can claim write slots and update statistics atomically and concurrently. This design is a cornerstone of ElixirScope's ability to offer "total recall" with minimal overhead, forming a reliable and fast foundation for the subsequent asynchronous processing and analysis stages. The claims of sub-microsecond performance are well-supported by this architectural choice.
