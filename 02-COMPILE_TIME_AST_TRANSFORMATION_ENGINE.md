## 1. Introduction and Purpose

### 1.1. Role in Achieving Automatic Instrumentation

One of ElixirScope's primary goals is to provide deep observability with minimal setup. This necessitates automatic instrumentation of the target application. The Compile-Time AST Transformation Engine is the component that achieves this by programmatically modifying the application's Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) before it is compiled into BEAM bytecode. This allows ElixirScope to inject calls to its `InstrumentationRuntime` at strategic points (e.g., function entries/exits, callback invocations) without requiring developers to manually add tracing code.

### 1.2. Design Goals

*   **Transparency:** The instrumentation process should be largely invisible to the developer during normal coding. The original source code remains untouched.
*   **Correctness:** Instrumented code *must* retain the exact same semantic behavior as the original code, apart from the added tracing calls. It should not introduce bugs or alter application logic.
*   **Configurability:** The extent and nature of instrumentation should be controllable via the AI-driven instrumentation plan, allowing for different levels of detail (e.g., minimal, performance-focused, full-recall).
*   **Performance (Compilation):** The transformation process should not add an unreasonable overhead to the project's overall compilation time.
*   **Performance (Runtime):** The injected code itself must be highly optimized to meet ElixirScope's low runtime overhead targets (delegating heavy work to `InstrumentationRuntime`).

## 2. Architectural Overview

The AST transformation process involves several coordinated components, as illustrated in `DIAGS.md#1. Overall System Architecture` (Layers 0 & 1) and `DIAGS.md#6. AST Transformation Process`.

### 2.1. `ElixirScope.Compiler.MixTask` (Mix Compiler)

This custom Mix compiler (`Mix.Tasks.Compile.ElixirScope`) is the entry point for AST transformation. It integrates into the Elixir build pipeline.

### 2.2. `ElixirScope.AI.Orchestrator` (Provides Instrumentation Plan)

Before transformation, the `MixTask` queries the `AI.Orchestrator` to obtain the current instrumentation plan. This plan dictates which modules, functions, and callbacks should be instrumented and how.

### 2.3. `ElixirScope.AST.Transformer` (Core Transformation Logic)

This module contains the core logic for traversing Elixir ASTs and applying modifications based on the instrumentation plan.

### 2.4. `ElixirScope.AST.InjectorHelpers` (Code Generation Utilities)

This module provides helper functions that generate the quoted AST snippets for the actual instrumentation calls (e.g., calls to `InstrumentationRuntime` functions).

### 2.5. Interaction with `ElixirScope.Capture.InstrumentationRuntime`

The ultimate goal of the AST transformation is to inject calls to functions defined in `ElixirScope.Capture.InstrumentationRuntime`. These runtime functions are responsible for capturing the actual event data.

## 3. `ElixirScope.Compiler.MixTask` Implementation

The `ElixirScope.Compiler.MixTask` module (implementing `Mix.Task.Compiler` behaviour) is crucial for integrating instrumentation into the standard Elixir build process.

### 3.1. `Mix.Task.Compiler` Behaviour Integration

*   It defines a `run/1` function, which is the entry point invoked by Mix.
*   It needs to be added to the `:compilers` list in the project's `mix.exs` file, *before* the standard `:elixir` compiler to ensure it processes source code first.
    ```elixir
    # In target project's mix.exs
    def project do
      [
        app: :my_app,
        version: "0.1.0",
        elixirc_paths: elixirc_paths(Mix.env()),
        compilers: [:elixir_scope | Mix.compilers()], # Add ElixirScope compiler
        # ...
      ]
    end
    ```

### 3.2. Compiler Ordering

By placing `:elixir_scope` before other compilers (like `:elixir`) in the `Mix.project/0`'s `:compilers` list, Mix ensures that `ElixirScope.Compiler.MixTask.run/1` is executed on the source files before the standard Elixir compiler processes them.

### 3.3. Fetching Instrumentation Plans from `AI.Orchestrator`

Inside its `run/1` function, the `MixTask` will:
1.  Ensure `ElixirScope.AI.Orchestrator` is running.
2.  Call `ElixirScope.AI.Orchestrator.get_instrumentation_plan()` (or a similar function) to retrieve the active plan. This plan might be cached or generated on-demand if not present.

### 3.4. File Traversal and AST Parsing

The `MixTask` receives a list of files to compile from Mix. For each Elixir source file (`.ex`, `.exs`):
1.  It reads the file content (`File.read!/1`).
2.  It parses the source code into an AST using `Code.string_to_quoted/2`.
3.  It determines if this module/file is targeted for instrumentation based on the plan.

### 3.5. Outputting Transformed Code for Standard Compilation

If a file's AST is transformed by `ElixirScope.AST.Transformer`:
1.  The modified AST is converted back into Elixir source code using `Macro.to_string/1`.
2.  This transformed source code is written to a temporary file, typically within the `_build` directory (e.g., `_build/dev/lib/my_app/elixir_scope_instrumented/my_module.ex`). The path must be structured such that the standard Elixir compiler can find and compile it correctly, respecting the original module name and project structure.
3.  The Mix compiler interface likely requires the custom compiler to return a list of artifacts or indicate success/failure. ElixirScope's task needs to inform Mix that the original source file has effectively been "handled" by providing an intermediate, instrumented version.

### 3.6. Handling Incremental Compilation and Dependencies

Mix's compilation process is incremental. The `ElixirScope.Compiler.MixTask` must:
*   Respect Mix's tracking of modified files. It should only re-transform files that Mix indicates need recompilation.
*   Ensure that dependencies are correctly handled. If an instrumented module `A` depends on module `B`, and `B` is also instrumented, the compilation order must be correct. Mix typically handles this, but the paths to the instrumented `.beam` files must be consistent.
*   The instrumentation plan itself might change (e.g., due to AI re-analysis or config updates). The `MixTask` or `AI.Orchestrator` needs a mechanism to trigger recompilation of relevant files if the plan affecting them changes, even if the source files themselves haven't. This could involve managing manifest files or tracking plan versions.

### 3.7. Configuration and Command-Line Options

The `MixTask` could potentially accept command-line arguments (passed via `mix compile --elixir-scope-args "..."`) to override aspects of instrumentation for a specific build, although relying on `ElixirScope.Config` and AI plans is the primary mechanism.

## 4. `ElixirScope.AST.Transformer` Implementation

This module is the heart of the code modification logic.

### 4.1. AST Traversal Strategies (`Macro.prewalk/postwalk`)

`Macro.prewalk/2` and `Macro.postwalk/2` are standard tools for traversing Elixir ASTs.
*   **Pre-walk:** An operation is applied to a node *before* its children are visited. Useful for setting up context or transforming container nodes.
*   **Post-walk:** An operation is applied to a node *after* its children have been visited and potentially transformed. Useful for transformations that depend on the (possibly modified) structure of child nodes.
The `Transformer` uses these to recursively navigate the module's AST.

### 4.2. Identifying Target Nodes for Instrumentation

Within the AST traversal (e.g., in `transform_module_body/2`):
*   The `Transformer` looks for specific AST patterns that represent definitional constructs like `{:def, meta, [signature, body]}`, `{:defp, ...}`, etc.
*   For each such construct, it extracts key information (module name (implicit from context), function name, arity, callback type if applicable).
*   It then consults the relevant section of the instrumentation plan (e.g., `get_function_plan/3`, `get_genserver_callback_plan/2`) to see if and how this specific node should be instrumented.

### 4.3. Applying Instrumentation Directives from the Plan

The instrumentation plan contains directives for each targeted function/callback, such as:
*   `:type`: e.g., `:full_instrumentation`, `:performance_only`, `:state_tracking`.
*   `:capture_args`: boolean
*   `:capture_return`: boolean
*   `:capture_state_before`: boolean (for callbacks)
*   `:capture_state_after`: boolean (for callbacks)
The `Transformer` uses these directives to decide which specific helper functions from `InjectorHelpers` to call to generate the injected code.

### 4.4. Core Transformation Patterns

#### 4.4.1. Function Entry/Exit Wrapping (`try/catch/after`)

For a typical function, the transformation looks like:
```elixir
# Original:
# def my_func(a, b) do
#   # original body
# end

# Transformed (conceptual):
def my_func(a, b) do
  __elixir_scope_correlation_id__ = ElixirScope.Capture.InstrumentationRuntime.report_function_entry(MyModule, :my_func, [a, b], %{plan_directives})
  try do
    __elixir_scope_result__ = begin
      # original body
    end
    ElixirScope.Capture.InstrumentationRuntime.report_function_exit(__elixir_scope_correlation_id__, :normal, __elixir_scope_result__, %{plan_directives})
    __elixir_scope_result__
  catch
    kind, reason ->
      ElixirScope.Capture.InstrumentationRuntime.report_function_exit(__elixir_scope_correlation_id__, kind, reason, %{plan_directives})
      :erlang.raise(kind, reason, __STACKTRACE__) # Re-raise original error
  end
end
```
The `InjectorHelpers.wrap_with_try_catch/3` is responsible for generating this structure.

#### 4.4.2. Argument and Return Value Capture

This is controlled by plan directives. If `capture_args: true`, the `args` list passed to `report_function_entry` will contain the actual arguments (potentially truncated by `InstrumentationRuntime` or `Ingestor`). Similarly for `capture_return: true` and the result passed to `report_function_exit`.

#### 4.4.3. Exception Capture and Reporting

The `catch` block in the wrapped function body ensures that any exception raised by the original code is caught. The `kind` and `reason` (and stacktrace) are reported via `report_function_exit` (or a dedicated `report_exception` function) before the original exception is re-raised using `:erlang.raise/3` to maintain original program flow.

#### 4.4.4. State Capture for GenServer Callbacks

For GenServer callbacks (e.g., `handle_call/3`), the `Transformer` (using `InjectorHelpers`) injects:
*   A call to `InstrumentationRuntime.report_state_change` (or a more specific callback entry function) *before* the original callback body, capturing the `state` argument.
*   A call *after* the original callback body executes, capturing the `new_state` returned by the callback.
This allows tracking state evolution.

#### 4.4.5. Parameter and `conn` State Capture for Phoenix Actions

For Phoenix controller actions, plan directives can trigger injection of calls to capture `conn` assigns and `params` at the beginning of the action, and capture relevant parts of the `conn` (like status code, response headers) after the action completes.

#### 4.4.6. `assigns` and Event Data Capture for LiveView Callbacks

Similarly for LiveView, `handle_event` can capture the event name, payload, and `socket.assigns` before and after the handler executes to show diffs.

### 4.5. Preserving Original Code Semantics

This is paramount and one of the hardest aspects.
#### 4.5.1. Line Numbers and Debugging Metadata
Transformations must strive to preserve or correctly map original line numbers. The `meta` field in AST nodes carries this. Injected code should ideally not shift line numbers of original code significantly. Using `quote meta: meta` can help.
#### 4.5.2. Variable Scoping and Hygiene
`quote` with `unquote` is generally hygienic, preventing injected variables (like `__elixir_scope_correlation_id__`) from clashing with user variables. Care must be taken when capturing user variables by name. `var!(conn)` or `var!(socket)` is used to ensure captured variables are correctly referenced from the right scope.
#### 4.5.3. Guard Clauses and Multi-Clause Functions
Each function clause (including those with guards) must be instrumented independently. The transformation must apply to the body of each clause. `DIAGS.md#6` shows the plan affecting `DEF` and `BODY`, implying this clause-by-clause transformation.

## 5. `ElixirScope.AST.InjectorHelpers` Implementation

### 5.1. Role: Generating `quote`d AST Snippets

This module acts as a factory for AST segments that perform instrumentation. It takes details like function signature, plan directives, and names of variables to capture, and returns a quoted Elixir code block.

### 5.2. Common Injection Patterns

The code for `InjectorHelpers` contains functions like:
*   `report_function_entry_call(signature, function_plan)`: Generates the `quote` for `ElixirScope.Capture.InstrumentationRuntime.report_function_entry(...)`.
*   `wrap_with_try_catch(body, signature, function_plan)`: Creates the `try/catch` structure.
*   Specific helpers for GenServer state capture before/after: `capture_genserver_state_before_call`, `capture_genserver_state_after_call`.
*   Specific helpers for Phoenix: `capture_phoenix_params`, `capture_phoenix_conn_state_before`, etc.

### 5.3. Ensuring Correctness and Hygeine of Injected Code

*   Extensive use of `unquote` for splicing in dynamic parts (like function names, variable references).
*   Careful management of variables introduced by instrumentation to avoid clashes (e.g., using unique names like `__elixir_scope_...`). `Macro.var/2` is helpful here.
*   Ensuring that the overall structure of the transformed code still adheres to valid Elixir syntax and function clause rules.

## 6. Handling Elixir's Metaprogramming Features

### 6.1. Challenges with Macros

Macros expand into more AST *at compile time*. This poses a challenge:
*   Do we instrument the macro call itself, or the code it expands into?
*   Instrumenting expanded code is usually more accurate for runtime behavior.
*   **Strategy:**
    1.  The ElixirScope compiler runs. It sees a macro call.
    2.  It might choose to expand certain known macros (e.g., `use GenServer` might be expanded to analyze the generated `handle_call`, etc. definitions if the AI plan targets them directly).
    3.  Or, for user-defined macros, it might instrument the code *generated by* the macro if that generated code contains standard `def`s that match the instrumentation plan.
    4.  Alternatively, the AI planner might need to be aware of common macros and generate plans that specifically target the functions *known to be generated by* those macros (e.g., `YourApp.UserController` uses `Phoenix.Controller` which generates `call/2`).
*   The `TransformerTest` has placeholders like `phoenix_patterns_preserved?` indicating awareness of this challenge.
*   `FOUNDATION_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` section `7.1 AST Transformation Edge Cases` and `7.3 AI Analysis Advanced Patterns` (for architectural analysis including macros) are highly relevant.

### 6.2. `use`, `import`, `alias`, `require` directives

These directives influence the AST and available functions/macros.
*   `use Mod`: Calls `Mod.__using__/1` macro. The code injected by `__using__` will subsequently be seen by ElixirScope's `Transformer` if it defines functions.
*   `import`, `alias`, `require`: Generally do not need direct instrumentation themselves but affect how function calls are represented in the AST (e.g., fully qualified vs. local calls). The `Transformer` must correctly identify the target module/function regardless of these.

### 6.3. `__before_compile__` and `__after_compile__` hooks

These module attributes can also generate code or modify the module AST. The ElixirScope compiler must run at a stage where its transformations are applied before these hooks further modify the AST, or it must be aware of their potential impact if it runs after. Standard Mix compiler ordering should generally handle this correctly if ElixirScope's compiler runs early.

## 7. Performance Considerations

### 7.1. Impact on Project Compilation Time

*   AST parsing, traversal, transformation, and code generation add to compilation time.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Efficient AST traversal in `Transformer`.
    *   Caching of instrumentation plans by `AI.Orchestrator`.
    *   Leveraging Mix's incremental compilation to only re-transform changed files and their dependents (if plan structure affects dependencies).
    *   Optimizing the AI analysis phase itself.

### 7.2. Efficiency of AST Traversal and Transformation

The `Transformer` logic should avoid unnecessarily deep or repeated traversals. The plan-driven approach helps by targeting specific nodes rather than exhaustively checking every node for all possible transformations.

### 7.3. Minimizing Runtime Overhead of Injected Code

This is a primary goal. The injected code itself is minimal:
*   A few function calls to `InstrumentationRuntime`.
*   A `try/catch` block.
The `InstrumentationRuntime` is then responsible for the ultra-fast hot path. Complex logic is deferred to asynchronous processing.

## 8. Error Handling and Debuggability

### 8.1. Reporting Errors during Transformation

If the `Transformer` encounters an AST structure it cannot safely instrument according to the plan, or if the plan is invalid for a given AST:
*   It should log a clear error message pinpointing the module, function, and line.
*   It should ideally allow compilation to proceed *without* instrumenting the problematic code segment (fail-safe), rather than crashing the entire build.

### 8.2. Providing Source Mapping for Debugging Instrumented Code

Debugging the *instrumented* code can be confusing because the `.beam` files are generated from transformed AST, not original source.
*   Preserving line number metadata in the AST during transformation is crucial.
*   (Advanced) Generating source maps could theoretically link BEAM instructions back to original source lines, but this is complex.
*   The "Execution Cinema" UI itself, by showing events in context of original source (fetched by `QueryCoordinator`), alleviates some of this.

### 8.3. Allowing Selective Disabling of Instrumentation

Configuration options (`exclude_modules`, function-specific overrides in the plan) allow developers to bypass instrumentation for known problematic modules or performance-critical sections where even minimal overhead is unacceptable.

## 9. Testing Strategies for AST Transformation

`FOUNDATION_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` provides an excellent test specification in section `1.1` and `1.2`. Key aspects:
*   **Unit Tests (`TransformerTest`)**: Test transformation of diverse AST snippets (simple functions, guards, clauses, specific callbacks) against mock plans.
*   **Semantic Equivalence Tests**: This is CRITICAL. Compile a module with and without instrumentation. Run a comprehensive test suite against both versions. The functional behavior must be identical.
*   **Integration Tests (`MixTaskTest`)**: Test the entire `MixTask` flow: plan fetching, file processing, AST transformation, outputting code for the next compiler.
*   **Testing with Diverse Constructs:** Ensure macros (common ones like Phoenix resource routing, Ecto schemas, GenServer `use`), protocols, implementations, structs, etc., are handled correctly (either instrumented appropriately or passed through safely).

## 10. Current Status and Future Enhancements

*   **Current Status (as per `PROGRESS.md` and code review):**
    *   `AST.Transformer` and `AST.InjectorHelpers` have substantial foundational code.
    *   `TransformerTest` shows many cases are considered.
    *   `Compiler.MixTask` has a basic structure but needs full integration with `AI.Orchestrator` and robust file handling/output.
    *   The documentation notes "AST Transformation Engine (In Progress)".
*   **Future Enhancements:**
    *   More sophisticated macro handling (e.g., AI understanding of macro semantics).
    *   Finer-grained instrumentation (e.g., tracing specific variable assignments within a function, conditional tracing based on runtime values - though the latter might be more of a runtime feature).
    *   Direct BEAM bytecode manipulation for ultimate performance and control (very advanced).
    *   Hot-swapping instrumentation plans at runtime without recompilation (would require a different runtime mechanism than purely compile-time injection).

## 11. Conclusion

The Compile-Time AST Transformation Engine is a complex but essential part of ElixirScope. It enables the "automatic" and "intelligent" aspects of instrumentation. By integrating with the Mix build process and leveraging Elixir's powerful metaprogramming capabilities, it can systematically inject tracing into an application. The main challenges lie in ensuring semantic correctness across all Elixir language features (especially macros) and keeping compilation overhead acceptable. The current foundation is promising, and completing its robust implementation as per the test specifications in `FOUNDATION_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` will be a major step towards realizing the ElixirScope vision.
