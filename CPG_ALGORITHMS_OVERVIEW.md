# CPG Algorithms Overview

**`CPG_ALGORITHMS_OVERVIEW.MD`**

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a high-level overview of the **CPG Algorithmic Enhancement Layer** for ElixirScope. This layer builds upon the existing Code Property Graph (CPG) infrastructure, which unifies Abstract Syntax Trees (AST), Control Flow Graphs (CFG), and Data Flow Graphs (DFG), to introduce advanced graph-theoretic analysis capabilities.

The primary goal of this layer is to extract deeper, more nuanced insights from the codebase by applying formal graph algorithms and adapting them with code-specific semantics. These enhanced analytics will power more sophisticated querying, pattern detection, and AI-driven features within ElixirScope.

## 2. Core Components

The CPG Algorithmic Enhancement Layer consists of several conceptual components:

*   **`CPGMath`**: A foundational component responsible for implementing or integrating standard graph algorithms that can operate on the ElixirScope CPG. This includes algorithms for pathfinding, centrality, community detection, and cycle detection.
*   **`CPGSemantics`**: This component adapts the mathematical algorithms from `CPGMath` to the specific context of source code. It introduces semantic weighting for CPG nodes and edges, incorporates Elixir-specific heuristics, and enables code-aware interpretations of graph properties.
*   **`CPGOptimizer`**: Focuses on the performance and scalability of CPG operations. This includes strategies for incremental CPG updates, query optimization for graph-based queries, and potentially memory-efficient CPG representations.
*   **Enhanced Query Capabilities**: Extensions to `ElixirScope.ASTRepository.QueryBuilder` and `ElixirScope.ASTRepository.QueryExecutor` (or potentially new modules like `ElixirScope.QueryEngine.CPGExtensions`) to allow users and AI components to query based on algorithmic results (e.g., centrality scores, community membership, impact analysis).
*   **Advanced Pattern Detection**: Enhancements to `ElixirScope.ASTRepository.PatternMatcher` to leverage graph-theoretic properties for detecting complex structural and behavioral patterns and anti-patterns.

## 3. Key Algorithmic Capabilities

### 3.1. Pathfinding and Reachability

*   **Standard Shortest/Longest Paths**: Based on configurable edge weights (e.g., number of hops, AST complexity).
*   **Semantic Paths**: Code-aware pathfinding, considering factors like control flow probability, data dependency strength, and semantic similarity between nodes.
    *   Example: Find the most likely execution path between two functions that involves specific variable manipulation.
*   **Reachability Analysis**: Determining if one CPG node can influence or be influenced by another, considering various types of dependencies (control, data, call).

### 3.2. Centrality Analysis

Measures the "importance" or "influence" of CPG nodes (modules, functions, variables, AST constructs).
*   **Degree Centrality**: Number of direct connections (e.g., functions with many callers/callees).
*   **Betweenness Centrality**: Nodes that act as bridges in information flow (e.g., critical functions in data pipelines).
*   **Closeness Centrality**: Nodes that can reach other nodes quickly (e.g., utility functions).
*   **Eigenvector/PageRank Centrality**: Nodes connected to other important nodes (e.g., core framework modules or critical business logic).
*   **Code-Aware Interpretation**: High centrality might indicate a "God Object" (anti-pattern) or a critical, well-utilized abstraction.

### 3.3. Community Detection

Identifies groups of CPG nodes that are more densely connected internally than with the rest of the graph.
*   **Module Cohesion**: Detect modules whose internal functions and data structures are highly interrelated.
*   **Feature Grouping**: Identify sets of functions and modules that work together to implement a specific feature.
*   **Architectural Slicing**: Understand sub-systems within the application.
*   **Code-Aware Interpretation**: Communities can highlight well-encapsulated components or, conversely, areas where concerns are not well separated.

### 3.4. Cycle Detection (Strongly Connected Components - SCCs)

*   **Circular Dependencies**: Detect circular dependencies between modules, functions (recursive or mutually recursive calls), or even complex data flow cycles.
*   **Architectural Smells**: Identify overly complex or tangled parts of the codebase.

### 3.5. Dependency and Impact Analysis

*   **Upstream/Downstream Analysis**: Given a CPG node, identify all nodes that depend on it (downstream) and all nodes it depends on (upstream).
*   **Change Impact Radius**: Estimate the "blast radius" of a potential code change by analyzing the reach of its dependencies through the CPG.
*   **"Shotgun Surgery" Detection**: Identify components where a single logical change requires modifications in many loosely coupled parts of the CPG.

## 4. Integration with Existing ElixirScope Systems

*   **CPGData**: The core data structure (`ElixirScope.ASTRepository.Enhanced.CPGData`) will be augmented to store or link to results of these algorithmic analyses (e.g., centrality scores per node, community IDs, cached path results).
*   **Query Engine**: The Query Engine (`ElixirScope.QueryEngine.Engine` and `ElixirScope.QueryEngine.ASTExtensions`) will be extended to:
    *   Allow filtering and ordering based on these new algorithmic metrics.
    *   Execute new query types that directly invoke these algorithms (e.g., `find_critical_path`, `get_impact_analysis`).
*   **Pattern Matcher**: `ElixirScope.ASTRepository.PatternMatcher` will use graph properties (e.g., high centrality, membership in a problematic SCC) as part of its rules for detecting complex patterns and anti-patterns.
*   **AI Components**:
    *   `ElixirScope.AI.Analysis.IntelligentCodeAnalyzer` and `ElixirScope.AI.Predictive.ExecutionPredictor` will consume these richer CPG features to improve their analyses and predictions.
    *   LLM interactions via `ElixirScope.AI.LLM.Client` can be provided with more structured and semantically rich context derived from these algorithms.
*   **MemoryManager**: `ElixirScope.ASTRepository.MemoryManager` may need to manage caching and eviction for the results of computationally expensive graph algorithms.
*   **UI/Visualization (Future)**: The derived metrics and structures (communities, critical paths) are prime candidates for visualization in the ElixirScope UI or IDE integrations.

## 5. Benefits

*   **Deeper Code Insights**: Go beyond simple AST/CFG/DFG views to understand complex relationships and emergent properties of the codebase.
*   **More Powerful Queries**: Ask more sophisticated questions about code structure, dependencies, and potential issues.
*   **Improved AI Analysis**: Provide richer, more structured input to AI models, leading to more accurate and actionable insights.
*   **Proactive Issue Detection**: Identify architectural smells, complex dependencies, and potential maintenance hotspots before they become major problems.
*   **Enhanced Debugging**: Facilitate understanding of complex execution flows and data propagation.

This CPG Algorithmic Enhancement Layer represents a significant step towards making ElixirScope a truly intelligent and revolutionary tool for Elixir developers.
