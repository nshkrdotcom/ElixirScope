# ElixirScope Project Continuation Prompt

## Current Project State

We are working on a Phoenix LiveView application called "phoenix_scope_player" for debugging session playback. The application has been partially implemented with the following key components:

1. **Session Data Structure**
   - Events are stored in JSON format
   - Each session contains metadata, events, and source code
   - Events include function calls, returns, and variable states

2. **Working Features**
   - Session listing on homepage shows event counts
   - Basic playback interface implemented
   - Event navigation (Previous/Next) functionality
   - Source code viewer with file selection

3. **Current Issues**
   - Detail page needs improvement in displaying session information
   - Session metadata display needs enhancement
   - Some process lifecycle events are marked as "Unhandled trace messages"

## Development Environment

- Using Phoenix LiveView
- Mix commands:
  - `mix test.trace` - For bypassing slow live LLM API tests
  - `mix test.all` or `mix test.live` - For testing LLM integrations
  - `mixsw` - Alias to suppress warnings and show only errors

## Next Steps

Please attach the following documents to continue development:
1. Original CURSOR.md for base project context
2. ELIXIRSCOPE_DOCS.md for ElixirScope-specific documentation

## Current Focus

The immediate focus is on improving the session playback interface, specifically:
1. Enhancing session metadata display
2. Improving event visualization
3. Better handling of trace messages
